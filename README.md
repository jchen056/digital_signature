### About Julia

- flexible **dynamic language**, appropriate for **scientific and numerical computing**, with performance comparable to traditional statically-typed languages.
- Julia's compiler is different from the interpreters used for languages like Python or R
- Julia's compiler is different from the interpreters used for languages like Python or R
- **IJulia** is a Julia-language backend combined with the Jupyter interactive environment (also used by IPython). This combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using Jupyter/IPython's powerful graphical notebook, which combines code, formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single document. IJulia is a Jupyter language kernel and works with a variety of notebook user interfaces. In addition to the classic Jupyter Notebook, IJulia also works with JupyterLab, a Jupyter-based integrated development environment for notebooks and code. The nteract notebook desktop supports IJulia with detailed instructions for its installation with nteract.

### Installation

1. Download Julia: https://julialang.org/downloads/
2. Install IJulia: using Pkg
   Pkg.add("IJulia")

### Intro to C

- C is a general-purpose programming language. **very fast**, compared to other programming languages.
- C++ was developed as an extension of C. The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not

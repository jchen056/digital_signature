* Julia's compiler is different from the interpreters used for languages like Python or R
* **IJulia** is a Julia-language backend combined with the Jupyter interactive environment (also used by IPython). This combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using Jupyter/IPython's powerful graphical notebook, which combines code, formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single document. IJulia is a Jupyter language kernel and works with a variety of notebook user interfaces. In addition to the classic Jupyter Notebook, IJulia also works with JupyterLab, a Jupyter-based integrated development environment for notebooks and code. The nteract notebook desktop supports IJulia with detailed instructions for its installation with nteract.
